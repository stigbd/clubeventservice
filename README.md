## Competition
An competition may be one or more races. The competition is dedicated to one class of competitors.

The start list can be created with a draw, using a point system, a cup standing, a stage event overall standing, a qualification system or other methods.

A race is given a start list and produces a result list, which is an ordering of the competitors.
